Project goal

Simple application to allow participants of a network to stack-rank vote on propositions

V1

1 address == 1 vote
assumes off-chain verification that each person has only one verified address

admins
deployer of contract will be an admin

only admins can... 
- grant admin permissions to other contracts
- add addresses to the whitelist (to allow them to vote)
- create & open voting on a proposal
- close voting on a proposal

all voters can...
- vote once on a proposal

assumes admins will not be malicious...

voters

who are the entities in this application?
- admins
- voters
- votes
- polls / ballots / propositions
- democracy / community / network
  - maintains whitelist of participants

design considerations....
- state machine for polls? can only vote if open...
- how to represent voters & admins? Voter struct? mapping of address to booleans (isAdmin)?

only admins can create proposals

admins determ


V2
reasonable way to establish how long polls stay open
polls will need additional status (enum?) created, open, closed

V3
% of network required to participate for a poll to be valid
  will need to keep track of voterCount

V4
1 token == 1 vote
Avoids abuse of potentially 1 attacker having >1 addresses
Allows participants to join without maintaining a whitelist
